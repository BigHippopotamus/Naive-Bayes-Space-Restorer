"To give me an idea of how many of you here may find what Im about to tell you of practical value, let me ask you please to raise your hands. Who here is either over 65 years old or hopes to live past age 65 or has parents or grandparents who did live or have lived past 65, raise your hands please. Okay. You are the people to whom my talk will be of practical value. The rest of you wont find my talk personally relevant, but I think that you will still find the subject fascinating. Im going to talk about growing older in traditional societies. This subject constitutes just one chapter of my latest book, which compares traditional, small, tribal societies with our large, modern societies, with respect to many topics such as bringing up children, growing older, health, dealing with danger, settling disputes, religion and speaking more than one language. Those tribal societies, which constituted all human societies for most of human history, are far more diverse than are our modern, recent, big societies. All big societies that have governments, and where most people are strangers to each other, are inevitably similar to each other and different from tribal societies. Tribes constitute thousands of natural experiments in how to run a human society. They constitute experiments from which we ourselves may be able to learn. Tribal societies shouldnt be scorned as primitive and miserable, but also they shouldnt be romanticized as happy and peaceful. When we learn of tribal practices, some of them will horrify us, but there are other tribal practices which, when we hear about them, we may admire and envy and wonder whether we could adopt those practices ourselves. Most old people in the U.S. end up living separately from their children and from most of their friends of their earlier years, and often they live in separate retirements homes for the elderly, whereas in traditional societies, older people instead live out their lives among their children, their other relatives, and their lifelong friends. Nevertheless, the treatment of the elderly varies enormously among traditional societies, from much worse to much better than in our modern societies. At the worst extreme, many traditional societies get rid of their elderly in one of four increasingly direct ways, by neglecting their elderly and not feeding or cleaning them until they die, or by abandoning them when the group moves, or by encouraging older people to commit suicide, or by killing older people. In which tribal societies do children abandon or kill their parents. It happens mainly under two conditions. One is in nomadic, hunter gather societies that often shift camp and that are physically incapable of transporting old people who cant walk when the able bodied younger people already have to carry their young children and all their physical possessions. The other condition is in societies living in marginal or fluctuating environments, such as the Arctic or deserts, where there are periodic food shortages, and occasionally there just isnt enough food to keep everyone alive. Whatever food is available has to be reserved for able bodied adults and for children. To us Americans, it sounds horrible to think of abandoning or killing your own sick wife or husband or elderly mother or father, but what could those traditional societies do differently. They face a cruel situation of no choice. Their old people had to do it to their own parents, and the old people know what now is going to happen to them. At the opposite extreme in treatment of the elderly, the happy extreme, are the New Guinea farming societies where Ive been doing my fieldwork for the past 50 years, and most other sedentary traditional societies around the world. In those societies, older people are cared for. They are fed. They remain valuable. And they continue to live in the same hut or else in a nearby hut near their children, relatives and lifelong friends. There are two main sets of reasons for this variation among societies in their treatment of old people. The variation depends especially on the usefulness of old people and on the societys values. First, as regards usefulness, older people continue to perform useful services. One use of older people in traditional societies is that they often are still effective at producing food. Another traditional usefulness of older people is that they are capable of babysitting their grandchildren, thereby freeing up their own adult children, the parents of those grandchildren, to go hunting and gathering food for the grandchildren. Still another traditional value of older people is in making tools, weapons, baskets, pots and textiles. In fact, theyre usually the people who are best at it. Older people usually are the leaders of traditional societies, and the people most knowledgeable about politics, medicine, religion, songs and dances. Finally, older people in traditional societies have a huge significance that would never occur to us in our modern, literate societies, where our sources of information are books and the Internet. In contrast, in traditional societies without writing, older people are the repositories of information. Its their knowledge that spells the difference between survival and death for their whole society in a time of crisis caused by rare events for which only the oldest people alive have had experience. Those, then, are the ways in which older people are useful in traditional societies. Their usefulness varies and contributes to variation in the societys treatment of the elderly. The other set of reasons for variation in the treatment of the elderly is the societys cultural values. For example, theres particular emphasis on respect for the elderly in East Asia, associated with Confucius doctrine of filial piety, which means obedience, respect and support for elderly parents. Cultural values that emphasize respect for older people contrast with the low status of the elderly in the U.S. Older Americans are at a big disadvantage in job applications. Theyre at a big disadvantage in hospitals. Our hospitals have an explicit policy called age based allocation of healthcare resources. That sinister expression means that if hospital resources are limited, for example if only one donor heart becomes available for transplant, or if a surgeon has time to operate on only a certain number of patients, American hospitals have an explicit policy of giving preference to younger patients over older patients on the grounds that younger patients are considered more valuable to society because they have more years of life ahead of them, even though the younger patients have fewer years of valuable life experience behind them. There are several reasons for this low status of the elderly in the U.S. One is our Protestant work ethic which places high value on work, so older people who are no longer working arent respected. Another reason is our American emphasis on the virtues of self reliance and independence, so we instinctively look down on older people who are no longer self reliant and independent. Still a third reason is our American cult of youth, which shows up even in our advertisements. Ads for Coca Cola and beer always depict smiling young people, even though old as well as young people buy and drink Coca Cola and beer. Just think, whats the last time you saw a Coke or beer ad depicting smiling people 85 years old. Never. Instead, the only American ads featuring white haired old people are ads for retirement homes and pension planning. Well, what has changed in the status of the elderly today compared to their status in traditional societies. There have been a few changes for the better and more changes for the worse. Big changes for the better include the fact that today we enjoy much longer lives, much better health in our old age, and much better recreational opportunities. Another change for the better is that we now have specialized retirement facilities and programs to take care of old people. Changes for the worse begin with the cruel reality that we now have more old people and fewer young people than at any time in the past. That means that all those old people are more of a burden on the few young people, and that each old person has less individual value. Another big change for the worse in the status of the elderly is the breaking of social ties with age, because older people, their children, and their friends, all move and scatter independently of each other many times during their lives. We Americans move on the average every five years. Hence our older people are likely to end up living distant from their children and the friends of their youth. Yet another change for the worse in the status of the elderly is formal retirement from the workforce, carrying with it a loss of work friendships and a loss of the self esteem associated with work. Perhaps the biggest change for the worse is that our elderly are objectively less useful than in traditional societies. Widespread literacy means that they are no longer useful as repositories of knowledge. When we want some information, we look it up in a book or we Google it instead of finding some old person to ask. The slow pace of technological change in traditional societies means that what someone learns there as a child is still useful when that person is old, but the rapid pace of technological change today means that what we learn as children is no longer useful 60 years later. And conversely, we older people are not fluent in the technologies essential for surviving in modern society. For example, as a 15 year old, I was considered outstandingly good at multiplying numbers because I had memorized the multiplication tables and I know how to use logarithms and Im quick at manipulating a slide rule. Today, though, those skills are utterly useless because any idiot can now multiply eight digit numbers accurately and instantly with a pocket calculator. Conversely, I at age 75 am incompetent at skills essential for everyday life. My familys first TV set in 1948 had only three knobs that I quickly mastered, an on off switch, a volume knob, and a channel selector knob. Today, just to watch a program on the TV set in my own house, I have to operate a 41 button TV remote that utterly defeats me. I have to telephone my 25 year old sons and ask them to talk me through it while I try to push those wretched 41 buttons. What can we do to improve the lives of the elderly in the U.S., and to make better use of their value. Thats a huge problem. In my remaining four minutes today, I can offer just a few suggestions. One value of older people is that they are increasingly useful as grandparents for offering high quality childcare to their grandchildren, if they choose to do it, as more young women enter the workforce and as fewer young parents of either gender stay home as full time caretakers of their children. Compared to the usual alternatives of paid babysitters and day care centers, grandparents offer superior, motivated, experienced child care. Theyve already gained experience from raising their own children. They usually love their grandchildren, and are eager to spend time with them. Unlike other caregivers, grandparents dont quit their job because they found another job with higher pay looking after another baby. A second value of older people is paradoxically related to their loss of value as a result of changing world conditions and technology. At the same time, older people have gained in value today precisely because of their unique experience of living conditions that have now become rare because of rapid change, but that could come back. For example, only Americans now in their 70s or older today can remember the experience of living through a great depression, the experience of living through a world war, and agonizing whether or not dropping atomic bombs would be more horrible than the likely consequences of not dropping atomic bombs. Most of our current voters and politicians have no personal experience of any of those things, but millions of older Americans do. Unfortunately, all of those terrible situations could come back. Even if they dont come back, we have to be able to plan for them on the basis of the experience of what they were like. Older people have that experience. Younger people dont. The remaining value of older people that Ill mention involves recognizing that while there are many things that older people can no longer do, there are other things that they can do better than younger people. A challenge for society is to make use of those things that older people are better at doing. Some abilities, of course, decrease with age. Those include abilities at tasks requiring physical strength and stamina, ambition, and the power of novel reasoning in a circumscribed situation, such as figuring out the structure of DNA, best left to scientists under the age of 30. Conversely, valuable attributes that increase with age include experience, understanding of people and human relationships, ability to help other people without your own ego getting in the way, and interdisciplinary thinking about large databases, such as economics and comparative history, best left to scholars over the age of 60. Hence older people are much better than younger people at supervising, administering, advising, strategizing, teaching, synthesizing, and devising long term plans. Ive seen this value of older people with so many of my friends in their 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s, who are still active as investment managers, farmers, lawyers and doctors. In short, many traditional societies make better use of their elderly and give their elderly more satisfying lives than we do in modern, big societies. Paradoxically nowadays, when we have more elderly people than ever before, living healthier lives and with better medical care than ever before, old age is in some respects more miserable than ever before. The lives of the elderly are widely recognized as constituting a disaster area of modern American society. We can surely do better by learning from the lives of the elderly in traditional societies. But whats true of the lives of the elderly in traditional societies is true of many other features of traditional societies as well. Of course, Im not advocating that we all give up agriculture and metal tools and return to a hunter gatherer lifestyle. There are many obvious respects in which our lives today are far happier than those in small, traditional societies. To mention just a few examples, our lives are longer, materially much richer, and less plagued by violence than are the lives of people in traditional societies. But there are also things to be admired about people in traditional societies, and perhaps to be learned from them. Their lives are usually socially much richer than our lives, although materially poorer. Their children are more self confident, more independent, and more socially skilled than are our children. They think more realistically about dangers than we do. They almost never die of diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and the other noncommunicable diseases that will be the causes of death of almost all of us in this room today. Features of the modern lifestyle predispose us to those diseases, and features of the traditional lifestyle protect us against them. Those are just some examples of what we can learn from traditional societies. I hope that you will find it as fascinating to read about traditional societies as I found it to live in those societies. Thank you. "
"My name is Jonathan Zittrain, and in my recent work Ive been a bit of a pessimist. So I thought this morning I would try to be the optimist, and give reason to hope for the future of the Internet by drawing upon its present. Now, it may seem like there is less hope today than there was before. People are less kind. There is less trust around. I dont know. As a simple example, we could run a test here. How many people have ever hitchhiked. I know. How many people have hitchhiked within the past 10 years. Right. So what has changed. Its not better public transportation. So thats one reason to think that we might be declensionists, going in the wrong direction. But I want to give you three examples to try to say that the trend line is in fact in the other direction, and its the Internet helping it along. So example number one, the Internet itself. These are three of the founders of the Internet. They were actually high school classmates together at the same high school in suburban Los Angles in the 1960s. You might have had a French club or a Debate club. They had a Lets build a global network club, and it worked out very well. They are pictured here for their 25th anniversary Newsweek retrospective on the Internet. And as you can tell, they are basically goof balls. They had one great limitation and one great freedom as they tried to conceive of a global network. The limitation was that they didnt have any money. No particular amount of capital to invest, of the sort that for a physical network you might need for trucks and people and a hub to move packages around overnight. They had none of that. But they had an amazing freedom, which was they didnt have to make any money from it. The Internet has no business plan, never did. No CEO, no firm responsible, singly, for building it. Instead, its folks getting together to do something for fun, rather than because they were told to, or because they were expecting to make a mint off of it. That ethos led to a network architecture, a structure that was unlike other digital networks then or since. So unusual, in fact, that it was said that its not clear the Internet could work. As late as 1992, IBM was known to say you couldnt possibly build a corporate network using Internet Protocol. And even some Internet engineers today say the whole thing is a pilot project and the jury is still out. Thats why the mascot of Internet engineering, if it had one, is said to be the bumblebee. Because the fur to wingspan ratio of the bumblebee is far too large for it to be able to fly. And yet, mysteriously, somehow the bee flies. Im pleased to say that, thanks to massive government funding, about three years ago we finally figured out how bees fly. Its very complicated, but it turns out they flap their wings very quickly. So what is this bizarre architecture configuration that makes the network sing and be so unusual. Well, to move data around from one place to another, again, its not like a package courier. Its more like a mosh pit. Imagine, you being part of a network where, youre maybe at a sporting event, and youre sitting in rows like this, and somebody asks for a beer, and it gets handed at the aisle. And your neighborly duty is to pass the beer along, at risk to your own trousers, to get it to the destination. No one pays you to do this. Its just part of your neighborly duty. And, in a way, thats exactly how packets move around the Internet, sometimes in as many as 25 or 30 hops, with the intervening entities that are passing the data around having no particular contractual or legal obligation to the original sender or to the receiver. Now, of course, in a mosh pit its hard to specify a destination. You need a lot of trust, but its not like, Im trying to get to Pensacola, please. So the Internet needs addressing and directions. It turns out there is no one overall map of the Internet. Instead, again, it is as if we are all sitting together in a theater, but we can only see amidst the fog the people immediately around us. So what do we do to figure out who is where. We turn to the person on the right, and we tell that person what we see on our left, and vice versa. And they can lather, rinse, repeat. And before you know it, you have a general sense of where everything is. This is how Internet addressing and routing actually work. This is a system that relies on kindness and trust, which also makes it very delicate and vulnerable. In rare but striking instances, a single lie told by just one entity in this honeycomb can lead to real trouble. So, for example, last year, the government of Pakistan asked its Internet service providers there to prevent citizens of Pakistan from seeing YouTube. There was a video there that the government did not like and they wanted to make sure it was blocked. This is a common occurrence. Governments everywhere are often trying to block and filter and censor content on the Internet. Well this one ISP in Pakistan chose to effectuate the block for its subscribers in a rather unusual way. It advertised, the way that you might be asked, if you were part of the Internet, to declare what you see near you, it advertised that near it, in fact, it had suddenly awakened to find that it was YouTube. Thats right, it said, I am YouTube. Which meant that packets of data from subscribers going to YouTube stopped at the ISP, since they thought they were already there, and the ISP threw them away unopened because the point was to block it. But it didnt stop there. You see, that announcement went one click out, which got reverberated, one click out. And it turns out that as you look at the postmortem of this event, you have at one moment perfectly working YouTube. Then, at moment number two, you have the fake announcement go out. And within two minutes, it reverberates around and YouTube is blocked everywhere in the world. If you were sitting in Oxford, England, trying to get to YouTube, your packets were going to Pakistan and they werent coming back. Now just think about that. One of the most popular websites in the world, run by the most powerful company in the world, and there was nothing that YouTube or Google were particularly privileged to do about it. And yet, somehow, within about two hours, the problem was fixed. How did this happen. Well, for a big clue, we turn to NANOG. The North American Network Operators Group, a group of people who, on a beautiful day outside, enter into a windowless room, at their terminals reading email and messages in fixed proportion font, like this, and they talk about networks. And some of them are mid level employees at Internet service providers around the world. And here is the message where one of them says, Looks like weve got a live one. We have a hijacking of YouTube. This is not a drill. Its not just the cluelessness of YouTube engineers. I promise. Something is up in Pakistan. And they came together to help find the problem and fix it. So its kind of like if your house catches on fire. The bad news is there is no fire brigade. The good news is random people apparate from nowhere, put out the fire and leave without expecting payment or praise. I was trying to think of the right model to describe this form of random acts of kindness by geeky strangers. You know, its just like the hail goes out and people are ready to help. And it turns out this model is everywhere, once you start looking for it. Example number two. Wikipedia. If a man named Jimbo came up to you in 2001 and said, Ive got a great idea. We start with seven articles that anybody can edit anything, at any time, and well get a great encyclopedia. Eh. Right. Dumbest idea ever. In fact, Wikipedia is an idea so profoundly stupid that even Jimbo never had it. Jimbos idea was for Nupedia. It was going to be totally traditional. He would pay people money because he was feeling like a good guy, and the money would go to the people and they would write the articles. The wiki was introduced so others could make suggestions on edits, as almost an afterthought, a back room. And then it turns out the back room grew to encompass the entire project. And today, Wikipedia is so ubiquitous that you can now find it on Chinese restaurant menus. I am not making this up. I have a theory I can explain later. Suffice it to say for now that I prefer my Wikipedia stir fried with pimentos. But now, Wikipedia doesnt just spontaneously work. How does it really work. It turns out there is a back room that is kind of windowless, metaphorically speaking. And there are a bunch of people who, on a sunny day, would rather be inside and monitoring this, the administrators notice board, itself a wiki page that anyone can edit. And you just bring your problems to the page. Its reminiscent of the description of history as one damn thing after another, right. Number one, Tendentious editing by user Andyvphil. Apologies, Andyvphil, if youre here today. Im not taking sides. Anon attacking me for reverting. Here is my favorite, A long story. It turns out there are more people checking this page for problems and wanting to solve them than there are problems arising on the page. And thats what keeps Wikipedia afloat. At all times, Wikipedia is approximately 45 minutes away from utter destruction. Right. There are spambots crawling it, trying to turn every article into an ad for a Rolex watch. Its this thin geeky line that keeps it going. Not because its a job, not because its a career, but because its a calling. Its something they feel impelled to do because they care about it. They even gather together in such groups as the Counter Vandalism Unit, Civility, Maturity, Responsibility, to just clean up the pages. It does make you wonder if there were, for instance, a massive, extremely popular Star Trek convention one weekend, who would be minding the store. So what we see, what we see in this phenomenon is something that the crazed, late traffic engineer Hans Monderman discovered in the Netherlands, and here in South Kensington, that sometimes if you remove some of the external rules and signs and everything else, you can actually end up with a safer environment in which people can function, and one in which they are more human with each other. Theyre realizing that they have to take responsibility for what they do. And Wikipedia has embraced this. Some of you may remember Star Wars Kid, the poor teenager who filmed himself with a golf ball retriever, acting as if it were a light saber. The film, without his permission or even knowledge at first, found its way onto the Internet. Hugely viral video. Extremely popular. Totally mortifying to him. Now, it being encyclopedic and all, Wikipedia had to do an article about Star Wars Kid. Every article on Wikipedia has a corresponding discussion page, and on the discussion page they had extensive argument among the Wikipedians as to whether to have his real name featured in the article. You could see arguments on both sides. Here is just a snapshot of some of them. They eventually decided, not unanimously by any means, not to include his real name, despite the fact that nearly all media reports did. They just didnt think it was the right thing to do. It was an act of kindness. And to this day, the page for Star Wars Kid has a warning right at the top that says you are not to put his real name on the page. If you do, it will be removed immediately, removed by people who may have disagreed with the original decision, but respect the outcome and work to make it stay because they believe in something bigger than their own opinion. As a lawyer, Ive got to say these guys are inventing the law and stare decisis and stuff like that as they go along. Now, this isnt just limited to Wikipedia. We see it on blogs all over the place. I mean, this is a 2005 Business Week cover. Wow. Blogs are going to change your business. I know they look silly. And sure they look silly. They start off on all sorts of goofy projects. This is my favorite goofy blog. Catsthatlooklikehitler dot com. You send in a picture of your cat if it looks like Hitler. Yeah, I know. Number four, its like, can you imagine coming home to that cat everyday. But then, you can see the same kind of whimsy applied to people. So this is a blog devoted to unfortunate portraiture. This one says, Bucolic meadow with split rail fence. Is that an animal carcass behind her. Youre like, You know. I think thats an animal carcass behind her. And its one after the other. But then you hit this one. Image removed at request of owner. Thats it. Image removed at request of owner. It turns out that somebody lampooned here wrote to the snarky guy that does the site, not with a legal threat, not with an offer of payment, but just said, Hey, would you mind. The person said, No, thats fine. I believe we can build architectures online to make such human requests that much easier to do, to make it possible for all of us to see that the data we encounter online is just stuff on which to click and paste and copy and forward that actually represents human emotion and endeavor and impact, and to be able to have an ethical moment where we decide how we want to treat it. I even think it can go into the real world. We can end up, as we get in a world with more censors, everywhere there is something filming you, maybe putting it online, to be able to have a little clip you could wear that says, You know, Id rather not. And then have technology that the person taking the photo will know later, this person requested to be contacted before this goes anywhere big, if you dont mind. And that person taking the photo can make a decision about how and whether to respect it. In the real world, we see filtering of this sort taking place in Pakistan. And we now have means that we can build, like this system, so that people can report the filtering as they encounter it. And its no longer just a I dont know. I couldnt get there. I guess Ill move on, but suddenly a collective consciousness about what is blocked and censored where online. In fact, talk about technology imitating life imitating tech, or maybe its the other way around. An NYU researcher here took little cardboard robots with smiley faces on them, and a motor that just drove them forward and a flag sticking out the back with a desired destination. It said, Can you help me get there. Released it on the streets of Manhattan. Theyll fund anything these days. Here is the chart of over 43 people helping to steer the robot that could not steer and get it on its way, from one corner from one corner of Washington Square Park to another. That leads to example number three, hitchhiking. Im not so sure hitchhiking is dead. Why. There is the Craigslist rideshare board. If it were called the Craigslist hitchhiking board, tumbleweeds would be blowing through it. But its the rideshare board, and its basically the same thing. Now why are people using it. I dont know. Maybe they think that, uh, killers dont plan ahead. No. I think the actual answer is that once you reframe it, once you get out of one set of stale expectations from a failed project that had its day, but now, for whatever reason, is tarnished, you can actually rekindle the kind of human kindness and sharing that something like this on Craigslist represents. And then you can highlight it into something like, yes, CouchSurfing.org. CouchSurfing, one guys idea to, at last, put together people who are going somewhere far away and would like to sleep on a strangers couch for free, with people who live far away, and would like someone they dont know to sleep on their couch for free. Its a brilliant idea. Its a bee that, yes, flies. Amazing how many successful couch surfings there have been. And if youre wondering, no, there have been no known fatalities associated with CouchSurfing. Although, to be sure, the reputation system, at the moment, works that you leave your report after the couch surfing experience, so there may be some selection bias there. So, my urging, my thought, is that the Internet isnt just a pile of information. Its not a noun. Its a verb. And when you go on it, if you listen and see carefully and closely enough, what you will discover is that that information is saying something to you. What its saying to you is what we heard yesterday, Demosthenes was saying to us. Its saying, Lets march. Thank you very much. "
"So in the winter of 2012, I went to visit my grandmothers house in South India, a place, by the way, where the mosquitos have a special taste for the blood of the American born. No joke. When I was there, I got an unexpected gift. It was this antique instrument made more than a century ago, hand carved from a rare wood, inlaid with pearls and with dozens of metal strings. Its a family heirloom, a link between my past, the country where my parents were born, and the future, the unknown places Ill take it. I didnt actually realize it at the time I got it, but it would later become a powerful metaphor for my work. We all know the saying, Theres no time like the present. But nowadays, it can feel like theres no time but the present. Whats immediate and ephemeral seems to dominate our lives, our economy and our politics. Its so easy to get caught up in the number of steps we took today or the latest tweet from a high profile figure. Its easy for businesses to get caught up in making immediate profits and neglect whats good for future invention. And its far too easy for governments to stand by while fisheries and farmland are depleted instead of conserved to feed future generations. I have a feeling that, at this rate, its going to be hard for our generation to be remembered as good ancestors. If you think about it, our species evolved to think ahead, to chart the stars, dream of the afterlife, sow seeds for later harvest. Some scientists call this superpower that we have mental time travel, and its responsible for pretty much everything we call human civilization, from farming to the Magna Carta to the internet, all first conjured in the minds of humans. But lets get real, if we look around us today, we dont exactly seem to be using this superpower quite enough, and that begs the question. Why not. Whats wrong is how our communities, businesses and institutions are designed. Theyre designed in a way thats impairing our foresight. I want to talk to you about the three key mistakes that I think were making. The first mistake is what we measure. When we look at the quarterly profits of a company or its near term stock price, thats often not a great measure of whether that company is going to grow its market share or be inventive in the long run. When we glue ourselves to the test scores that kids bring back from school, thats not necessarily whats great for those kids learning and curiosity in the long run. Were not measuring what really matters in the future. The second mistake were making that impairs our foresight is what we reward. When we celebrate a political leader or a business leader for the disaster she just cleaned up or the announcement she just made, were not motivating that leader to invest in preventing those disasters in the first place, or to put down payments on the future by protecting communities from floods or fighting inequality or investing in research and education. The third mistake that impairs our foresight is what we fail to imagine. Now, when we do think about the future, we tend to focus on predicting exactly whats next, whether were using horoscopes or algorithms to do that. But we spend a lot less time imagining all the possibilities the future holds. When the Ebola outbreak emerged in 2014 in West Africa, public health officials around the world had early warning signs and predictive tools that showed how that outbreak might spread, but they failed to fathom that it would, and they failed to act in time to intervene, and the epidemic grew to kill more than 11,000 people. When people with lots of resources and good forecasts dont prepare for deadly hurricanes, theyre often failing to imagine how dangerous they can be. Now, none of these mistakes that Ive described, as dismal as they might sound, are inevitable. In fact, theyre all avoidable. What we need to make better decisions about the future are tools that can aid our foresight, tools that can help us think ahead. Think of these as something like the telescopes that ship captains of yore used when they scanned the horizon. Only instead of for looking across distance and the ocean, these tools are for looking across time to the future. I want to share with you a few of the tools that Ive found in my research that I think can help us with foresight. The first tool I want to share with you I think of as making the long game pay now. This is Wes Jackson, a farmer I spent some time with in Kansas. And Jackson knows that the way that most crops are grown around the world today is stripping the earth of the fertile topsoil we need to feed future generations. He got together with a group of scientists, and they bred perennial grain crops which have deep roots that anchor the fertile topsoil of a farm, preventing erosion and protecting future harvests. But they also knew that in order to get farmers to grow these crops in the short run, they needed to boost the annual yields of the crops and find companies willing to make cereal and beer using the grains so that farmers could reap profits today by doing whats good for tomorrow. And this is a tried and true strategy. In fact, it was used by George Washington Carver in the South of the United States after the Civil War in the early 20th century. A lot of people have probably heard of Carvers 300 uses for the peanut, the products and recipes that he came up with that made the peanut so popular. But not everyone knows why Carver did that. He was trying to help poor Alabama sharecroppers whose cotton yields were declining, and he knew that planting peanuts in their fields would replenish those soils so that their cotton yields would be better a few years later. But he also knew it needed to be lucrative for them in the short run. Alright, so lets talk about another tool for foresight. This one I like to think of as keeping the memory of the past alive to help us imagine the future. So I went to Fukushima, Japan on the sixth anniversary of the nuclear reactor disaster there that followed the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami of 2011. When I was there, I learned about the Onagawa Nuclear Power Station, which was even closer to the epicenter of that earthquake than the infamous Fukushima Daiichi that we all know about. In Onagawa, people in the city actually fled to the nuclear power plant as a place of refuge. It was that safe. It was spared by the tsunamis. It was the foresight of just one engineer, Yanosuke Hirai, that made that happen. In the 1960s, he fought to build that power plant farther back from the coast at higher elevation and with a higher sea wall. He knew the story of his hometown shrine, which had flooded in the year 869 after a tsunami. It was his knowledge of history that allowed him to imagine what others could not. OK, one more tool of foresight. This one I think of as creating shared heirlooms. These are lobster fishermen on the Pacific coast of Mexico, and theyre the ones who taught me this. They have protected their lobster harvest there for nearly a century, and theyve done that by treating it as a shared resource that theyre passing on to their collected children and grandchildren. They carefully measure what they catch so that theyre not taking the breeding lobster out of the ocean. Across North America, there are more than 30 fisheries that are doing something vaguely similar to this. Theyre creating long term stakes in the fisheries known as catch shares which get fishermen to be motivated not just in taking whatever they can from the ocean today but in its long term survival. Now there are many, many more tools of foresight I would love to share with you, and they come from all kinds of places, investment firms that look beyond near term stock prices, states that have freed their elections from the immediate interests of campaign financiers. And were going to need to marshal as many of these tools as we can if we want to rethink what we measure, change what we reward and be brave enough to imagine what lies ahead. Not all this is going to be easy, as you can imagine. Some of these tools we can pick up in our own lives, some were going to need to do in businesses or in communities, and some we need to do as a society. The future is worth this effort. My own inspiration to keep up this effort is the instrument I shared with you. Its called a dilruba, and it was custom made for my great grandfather. He was a well known music and art critic in India in the early 20th century. My great grandfather had the foresight to protect this instrument at a time when my great grandmother was pawning off all their belongings, but thats another story. He protected it by giving it to the next generation, by giving it to my grandmother, and she gave it to me. When I first heard the sound of this instrument, it haunted me. It felt like hearing a wanderer in the Himalayan fog. It felt like hearing a voice from the past. Thats my friend Simran Singh playing the dilruba. When I play it, it sounds like a cats dying somewhere, so youre welcome. This instrument is in my home today, but it doesnt actually belong to me. Its my role to shepherd it in time, and that feels more meaningful to me than just owning it for today. This instrument positions me as both a descendant and an ancestor. It makes me feel part of a story bigger than my own. And this, I believe, is the single most powerful way we can reclaim foresight, by seeing ourselves as the good ancestors we long to be, ancestors not just to our own children but to all humanity. Whatever your heirloom is, however big or small, protect it and know that its music can resonate for generations. Thank you. "
"In 2013, a team of researchers held a math test. The exam was administered to over 1,100 American adults, and designed, in part, to test their ability to evaluate sets of data. Hidden among these math problems were two almost identical questions. Both problems used the same difficult data set, and each had one objectively correct answer. The first asked about the correlation between rashes and a new skin cream. The second asked about the correlation between crime rates and gun control legislation. Participants with strong math skills were much more likely to get the first question correct. But despite being mathematically identical, the results for the second question looked totally different. Here, math skills werent the best predictor of which participants answered correctly. Instead, another variable the researchers had been tracking came into play, political identity. Participants whose political beliefs aligned with a correct interpretation of the data were far more likely to answer the problem right. Even the studys top mathematicians were 45 percent more likely to get the second question wrong when the correct answer challenged their political beliefs. What is it about politics that inspires this kind of illogical error. Can someones political identity actually affect their ability to process information. The answer lies in a cognitive phenomenon that has become increasingly visible in public life, partisanship. While its often invoked in the context of politics, partisanship is more broadly defined as a strong preference or bias towards any particular group or idea. Our political, ethnic, religious, and national identities are all different forms of partisanship. Of course, identifying with social groups is an essential and healthy part of human life. Our sense of self is defined not only by who we are as individuals, but also by the groups we belong to. As a result, were strongly motivated to defend our group identities, protecting both our sense of self and our social communities. But this becomes a problem when the groups beliefs are at odds with reality. Imagine watching your favorite sports team commit a serious foul. You know thats against the rules, but your fellow fans think its totally acceptable. The tension between these two incompatible thoughts is called cognitive dissonance, and most people are driven to resolve this uncomfortable state of limbo. You might start to blame the referee, complain that the other team started it, or even convince yourself there was no foul in the first place. In a case like this, people are often more motivated to maintain a positive relationship with their group than perceive the world accurately. This behavior is especially dangerous in politics. On an individual scale, allegiance to a party allows people to create a political identity and support policies they agree with. But partisan based cognitive dissonance can lead people to reject evidence thats inconsistent with the party line or discredits party leaders. And when entire groups of people revise the facts in service of partisan beliefs, it can lead to policies that arent grounded in truth or reason. This problem isnt new, political identities have been around for centuries. But studies show that partisan polarization has increased dramatically in the last few decades. One theory explaining this increase is the trend towards clustering geographically in like minded communities. Another is the growing tendency to rely on partisan news or social media bubbles. These often act like echo chambers, delivering news and ideas from people with similar views. Fortunately, cognitive scientists have uncovered some strategies for resisting this distortion filter. One is to remember that youre probably more biased than you think. So when you encounter new information, make a deliberate effort to push through your initial intuition and evaluate it analytically. In your own groups, try to make fact checking and questioning assumptions a valued part of the culture. Warning people that they might have been presented with misinformation can also help. And when youre trying to persuade someone else, affirming their values and framing the issue in their language can help make people more receptive. We still have a long way to go before solving the problem of partisanship. But hopefully, these tools can help keep us better informed, and capable of making evidence based decisions about our shared reality."
"For over 40 years, Ive been a clinical social worker and a developmental psychologist. And it seemed almost natural for me to go into the helping professions. My parents had taught me to do good for others. And so I devoted my career to working with families in some of the toughest circumstances, poverty, mental illness, immigration, refugees. And for all those years, Ive worked with hope and with optimism. In the past five years, though, my hope and my optimism have been put to the test. Ive been so deeply disappointed in the way the United States government is treating families who are coming to our southern border, asking for asylum, desperate parents with children, from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, who only want to bring their kids to safety and security. They are fleeing some of the worst violence in the world. Theyve been attacked by gangs, assaulted, raped, extorted, threatened. They have faced death. And they cant turn to their police because the police are complicit, corrupt, ineffective. Then they get to our border, and we put them in detention centers, prisons, as if they were common criminals. Back in 2014, I met some of the first children in detention centers. And I wept. I sat in my car afterwards and I cried. I was seeing some of the worst suffering Id ever known, and it went against everything I believed in my country, the rule of law and everything my parents taught me. The way the United States has handled the immigrants seeking asylum in our country over the past five years, its wrong, just simply wrong. Tonight, I want to tell you that children in immigration detention are being traumatized. And we are causing the trauma. We in America, actually, those of us here tonight, will not necessarily be on the same page with respect to immigration. Well disagree on how were going to handle all those people who want to come to our country. Frankly, it doesnt matter to me whether youre a Republican or a Democrat, liberal or conservative. I want secure borders. I also want to keep the bad actors out. I want national security. And of course, youll have your ideas about those topics, too. But I think we can agree that America should not be doing harm. The government, the state, should not be in the business of hurting children. It should be protecting them, no matter whose children they are, your children, my grandchildren and the children of families just looking for asylum. Now, I could tell you story after story of children who have witnessed some of the worst violence in the world and are now sitting in detention. But two little boys have stayed with me over these past five years. One of them was Danny. Danny was seven and a half years old when I met him in a detention center in Karnes City, Texas, back in 2014. He was there with his mother and his brother, and they had fled Honduras. You know, Danny is one of these kids that you get to love instantly. Hes funny, hes innocent, hes charming and very expressive. And hes drawing pictures for me, and one of the pictures he drew for me was of the Revos Locos. this is the name that they gave to gangs in the town that he was in. I said to Danny, Danny, what makes them bad guys. Danny looked at me with puzzlement. I mean, the look was more like, Are you clueless or just stupid. He leaned in and he whispered, Dont you see. They smoke cigarettes. And they drink beer. Danny had learned, of course, about the evils of drinking and smoking. Then he said, And they carry guns. In one of the pictures, the stick figures of the Revos Locos are shooting at birds and at people. Danny told me about the day his uncle was killed by those Revos Locos and how he ran from his house to his uncles farmhouse, only to see his uncles dead body, his face disfigured by bullets. And Danny told me he saw his uncles teeth coming out the back of his head. He was only six at the time. Sometime after that, one of those Revos Locos beat little Danny badly, severely, and thats when his parents said, We have got to leave or they will kill us. So they set out. But Dannys father was a single leg amputee with a crutch, and he couldnt manage the rugged terrain. So he said to his wife, Go without me. Take our boys. Save our boys. So Mom and the boys set off. Danny told me he looked back, said goodbye to his father, looked back a couple of times until he lost sight of his father. In detention, he had not heard from his father. And its very likely that his father was killed by the Revos Locos, because he had tried to flee. I cant forget Danny. The other boy was Fernando. Now, Fernando was in the same detention center, roughly the same age as Danny. Fernando was telling me about the 24 hours he spent in isolation with his mother in the detention center, placed there because his mother had led a hunger strike among the mothers in the detention center, and now she was cracking under the pressure of the guards, who were threatening and being very abusive towards her and Fernando. As Fernando and I are talking in the small office, his mother burst in, and she says, They hear you. Theyre listening to you. And she dropped to her hands and knees, and she began to look under the table, groping under all the chairs. She looked at the electric sockets, at the corner of the room, the floor, the corner of the ceiling, at the lamp, at the air vent, looking for hidden microphones and cameras. I watched Fernando as he watched his mother spiral into this paranoid state. I looked in his eyes and I saw utter terror. After all, who would take care of him if she couldnt. It was just the two of them. They only had each other. I could tell you story after story, but I havent forgotten Fernando. And I know something about what that kind of trauma, stress and adversity does to children. So Im going to get clinical with you for a moment, and Im going to be the professor that I am. Under prolonged and intense stress, trauma, hardship, adversity, harsh conditions, the developing brain is harmed, plain and simple. Its wiring and its architecture are damaged. The childs natural stress response system is affected. Its weakened of its protective factors. Regions of the brain that are associated with cognition, intellectual abilities, judgment, trust, self regulation, social interaction, are weakened, sometimes permanently. That impairs childrens future. We also know that under stress, the childs immune system is suppressed, making them susceptible to infections. Chronic illnesses, like diabetes, asthma, cardiovascular disease, will follow those children into adulthood and likely shorten their lives. Mental health problems are linked to the breakdown of the body. I have seen children in detention who have recurrent and disturbing nightmares, night terrors, depression and anxiety, dissociative reactions, hopelessness, suicidal thinking and post traumatic stress disorders. And they regress in their behavior, like the 11 year old boy who began to wet his bed again after years of continence. And the eight year old girl who was buckling under the pressure and was insisting that her mother breastfeed her. That is what detention does to children. Now, you may ask. What do we do. What should our government do. Well, Im just a mental health professional, so all I really know is about childrens health and development. But I have some ideas. First, we need to reframe our practices. We need to replace fear and hostility with safety and compassion. We need to tear down the prison walls, the barbed wire, take away the cages. Instead of prison, or prisons, we should create orderly asylum processing centers, campus like communities where children and families can live together. We could take old motels, old army barracks, refit them so that children and parents can live as family units in some safety and normality, where kids can run around. In these processing centers, pediatricians, family doctors, dentists and nurses, would be screening, examining, treating and immunizing children, creating records that will follow them to their next medical provider. Social workers would be conducting mental health evaluations and providing treatment for those who need it. Those social workers would be connecting families to services that theyre going to need, wherever theyre headed. And teachers would be teaching and testing children and documenting their learning so that the teachers at the next school can continue those childrens education. Theres a lot more that we could do in these processing centers. A lot more. And you probably are thinking, this is pie in the sky stuff. Cant blame you. Well, let me tell you that refugee camps all over the world are holding families like those in our detention centers, and some of those refugee camps are getting it right far better than we are. The United Nations has issued reports describing refugee camps that protect childrens health and development. Children and parents live in family units and clusters of families are housed together. Parents are given work permits so they can earn some money, theyre given food vouchers so they can go to the local stores and shop. Mothers are brought together to cook healthy meals for the children, and children go to school every day and are taught. Afterwards, after school, they go home and they ride bikes, hang out with friends, do homework and explore the world, all the essentials for child development. We can get it right. We have the resources to get it right. What we need is the will and the insistence of Americans that we treat children humanely. You know, I cant forget Danny or Fernando. I wonder where they are today, and I pray that they are healthy and happy. They are only two of the many children I met and of the thousands we know about who have been in detention. I may be saddened by whats happened to the children, but Im inspired by them. I may cry, as I did, but I admire those childrens strength. They keep alive my hope and my optimism in the work I do. So while we may differ on our approach to immigration, we should be treating children with dignity and respect. We should do right by them. If we do, we can prepare those children who remain in the United States, prepare them to become productive, engaged members of our society. And those who will return to their countries whether voluntarily or not will be prepared to become the teachers, the merchants, the leaders in their country. And I hope together all of those children and parents could give testimony to the world about the goodness of our country and our values. But we have to get it right. So we can agree to disagree on immigration, but I hope we can agree on one thing, that none of us wants to look back at this moment in our history, when we knew we were inflicting lifelong trauma on children, and that we sat back and did nothing. That would be the greatest tragedy of all. Thank you. "
"In my early days as a graduate student, I went on a snorkeling trip off the coast of the Bahamas. Id actually never swum in the ocean before, so it was a bit terrifying. What I remember the most is, as I put my head in the water and I was trying really hard to breathe through the snorkel, this huge group of striped yellow and black fish came straight at me ... and I just froze. And then, as if it had suddenly changed its mind, came towards me and then swerved to the right and went right around me. It was absolutely mesmerizing. Maybe many of you have had this experience. Of course, theres the color and the beauty of it, but there was also just the sheer oneness of it, as if it wasnt hundreds of fish but a single entity with a single collective mind that was making decisions. When I look back, I think that experience really ended up determining what Ive worked on for most of my career. Im a computer scientist, and the field that I work in is artificial intelligence. And a key theme in AI is being able to understand intelligence by creating our own computational systems that display intelligence the way we see it in nature. Now, most popular views of AI, of course, come from science fiction and the movies, and Im personally a big Star Wars fan. But that tends to be a very human centric view of intelligence. When you think of a fish school, or when I think of a flock of starlings, that feels like a really different kind of intelligence. For starters, any one fish is just so tiny compared to the sheer size of the collective, so it seems that any one individual would have a really limited and myopic view of whats going on, and intelligence isnt really about the individual but somehow a property of the group itself. Secondly, and the thing that I still find most remarkable, is that we know that there are no leaders supervising this fish school. Instead, this incredible collective mind behavior is emerging purely from the interactions of one fish and another. Somehow, there are these interactions or rules of engagement between neighboring fish that make it all work out. So the question for AI then becomes, what are those rules of engagement that lead to this kind of intelligence, and of course, can we create our own. And thats the primary thing that I work on with my team in my lab. We work on it through theory, looking at abstract rule systems and thinking about the mathematics behind it. We also do it through biology, working closely with experimentalists. But mostly, we do it through robotics, where we try to create our own collective systems that can do the kinds of things that we see in nature, or at least try to. One of our first robotic quests along this line was to create our very own colony of a thousand robots. So very simple robots, but they could be programmed to exhibit collective intelligence, and thats what we were able to do. So this is what a single robot looks like. Its quite small, about the size of a quarter, and you can program how it moves, but it can also wirelessly communicate with other robots, and it can measure distances from them. And so now we can start to program exactly an interaction, a rule of engagement between neighbors. And once we have this system, we can start to program many different kinds of rules of engagement that you would see in nature. So for example, spontaneous synchronization, how audiences are clapping and suddenly start all clapping together, the fireflies flashing together. We can program rules for pattern formation, how cells in a tissue determine what role theyre going to take on and set the patterns of our bodies. We can program rules for migration, and in this way, were really learning from natures rules. But we can also take it a step further. We can actually take these rules that weve learned from nature and combine them and create entirely new collective behaviors of our very own. So for example, imagine that you had two different kinds of rules. So your first rule is a motion rule where a moving robot can move around other stationary robots. And your second rule is a pattern rule where a robot takes on a color based on its two nearest neighbors. So if I start with a blob of robots in a little pattern seed, it turns out that these two rules are sufficient for the group to be able to self assemble a simple line pattern. And if I have more complicated pattern rules, and I design error correction rules, we can actually create really, really complicated self assemblies, and heres what that looks like. So here, youre going to see a thousand robots that are working together to self assemble the letter K. The K is on its side. And the important thing is that no one is in charge. So any single robot is only talking to a small number of robots nearby it, and its using its motion rule to move around the half built structure just looking for a place to fit in based on its pattern rules. And even though no robot is doing anything perfectly, the rules are such that we can get the collective to do its goal robustly together. And the illusion becomes almost so perfect, you know, you just start to not even notice that theyre individual robots at all, and it becomes a single entity, kind of like the school of fish. So these are robots and rules in two dimensions, but we can also think about robots and rules in three dimensions. So what if we could create robots that could build together. And here, we can take inspiration from social insects. So if you think about mound building termites or you think about army ants, they create incredible, complex nest structures out of mud and even out of their own bodies. And like the system I showed you before, these insects actually also have pattern rules that help them determine what to build, but the pattern can be made out of other insects, or it could be made out of mud. And we can use that same idea to create rules for robots. So here, youre going to see some simulated robots. So the simulated robot has a motion rule, which is how it traverses through the structure, looking for a place to fit in, and it has pattern rules where it looks at groups of blocks to decide whether to place a block. And with the right motion rules and the right pattern rules, we can actually get the robots to build whatever we want. And of course, everybody wants their own tower. So once we have these rules, we can start to create the robot bodies that go with these rules. So here, you see a robot that can climb over blocks, but it can also lift and move these blocks and it can start to edit the very structure that its on. But with these rules, this is really only one kind of robot body that you could imagine. You could imagine many different kinds of robot bodies. So if you think about robots that maybe could move sandbags and could help build levees, or we could think of robots that built out of soft materials and worked together to shore up a collapsed building, so just the same kind of rules in different kinds of bodies. Or if, like my group, you are completely obsessed with army ants, then maybe one day we can make robots that can climb over literally anything including other members of their tribe, and self assemble things out of their own bodies. Once you understand the rules, just many different kinds of robot visions become possible. And coming back to the snorkeling trip, we actually understand a great deal about the rules that fish schools use. So if we can invent the bodies to go with that, then maybe there is a future where I and my group will get to snorkel with a fish school of our own creation. Each of these systems that I showed you brings us closer to having the mathematical and the conceptual tools to create our own versions of collective power, and this can enable many different kinds of future applications, whether you think about robots that build flood barriers or you think about robotic bee colonies that could pollinate crops or underwater schools of robots that monitor coral reefs, or if we reach for the stars and we thinking about programming constellations of satellites. In each of these systems, being able to understand how to design the rules of engagement and being able to create good collective behavior becomes a key to realizing these visions. So, so far Ive talked about rules for insects and for fish and for robots, but what about the rules that apply to our own human collective. And the last thought that Id like to leave you with is that science is of course itself an incredible manifestation of collective intelligence, but unlike the beautiful fish schools that I study, I feel we still have a much longer evolutionary path to walk. So in addition to working on improving the science of robot collectives, I also work on creating robots and thinking about rules that will improve our own scientific collective. Theres this saying that I love, who does science determines what science gets done. Imagine a society where we had rules of engagement where every child grew up believing that they could stand here and be a technologist of the future, or where every adult believed that they had the ability not just to understand but to change how science and technology impacts their everyday lives. What would that society look like. I believe that we can do that. I believe that we can choose our rules, and we engineer not just robots but we can engineer our own human collective, and if we do and when we do, it will be beautiful. Thank you. "
"Today Im going to talk to you about the problem of other minds. And the problem Im going to talk about is not the familiar one from philosophy, which is, How can we know whether other people have minds. That is, maybe you have a mind, and everyone else is just a really convincing robot. So thats a problem in philosophy, but for todays purposes Im going to assume that many people in this audience have a mind, and that I dont have to worry about this. There is a second problem that is maybe even more familiar to us as parents and teachers and spouses and novelists, which is, Why is it so hard to know what somebody else wants or believes. Or perhaps, more relevantly, Why is it so hard to change what somebody else wants or believes. I think novelists put this best. Like Philip Roth, who said, And yet, what are we to do about this terribly significant business of other people. So ill equipped are we all, to envision one anothers interior workings and invisible aims. So as a teacher and as a spouse, this is, of course, a problem I confront every day. But as a scientist, Im interested in a different problem of other minds, and that is the one Im going to introduce to you today. And that problem is, How is it so easy to know other minds. So to start with an illustration, you need almost no information, one snapshot of a stranger, to guess what this woman is thinking, or what this man is. And put another way, the crux of the problem is the machine that we use for thinking about other minds, our brain, is made up of pieces, brain cells, that we share with all other animals, with monkeys and mice and even sea slugs. And yet, you put them together in a particular network, and what you get is the capacity to write Romeo and Juliet. Or to say, as Alan Greenspan did, I know you think you understand what you thought I said, but Im not sure you realize that what you heard is not what I meant. So, the job of my field of cognitive neuroscience is to stand with these ideas, one in each hand. And to try to understand how you can put together simple units, simple messages over space and time, in a network, and get this amazing human capacity to think about minds. So Im going to tell you three things about this today. Obviously the whole project here is huge. And Im going to tell you just our first few steps about the discovery of a special brain region for thinking about other peoples thoughts. Some observations on the slow development of this system as we learn how to do this difficult job. And then finally, to show that some of the differences between people, in how we judge others, can be explained by differences in this brain system. So first, the first thing I want to tell you is that there is a brain region in the human brain, in your brains, whose job it is to think about other peoples thoughts. This is a picture of it. Its called the Right Temporo Parietal Junction. Its above and behind your right ear. And this is the brain region you used when you saw the pictures I showed you, or when you read Romeo and Juliet or when you tried to understand Alan Greenspan. And you dont use it for solving any other kinds of logical problems. So this brain region is called the Right TPJ. And this picture shows the average activation in a group of what we call typical human adults. Theyre MIT undergraduates. The second thing I want to say about this brain system is that although we human adults are really good at understanding other minds, we werent always that way. It takes children a long time to break into the system. Im going to show you a little bit of that long, extended process. The first thing Im going to show you is a change between age three and five, as kids learn to understand that somebody else can have beliefs that are different from their own. So Im going to show you a five year old who is getting a standard kind of puzzle that we call the false belief task. Rebecca Saxe , This is the first pirate. His name is Ivan. And you know what pirates really like. Child. What. Pirates really like cheese sandwiches. Child. Cheese. I love cheese. Yeah. So Ivan has this cheese sandwich, and he says, Yum yum yum yum yum. I really love cheese sandwiches. And Ivan puts his sandwich over here, on top of the pirate chest. And Ivan says, You know what. I need a drink with my lunch. And so Ivan goes to get a drink. And while Ivan is away the wind comes, and it blows the sandwich down onto the grass. And now, here comes the other pirate. This pirate is called Joshua. And Joshua also really loves cheese sandwiches. So Joshua has a cheese sandwich and he says, Yum yum yum yum yum. I love cheese sandwiches. And he puts his cheese sandwich over here on top of the pirate chest. Child. So, that one is his. That one is Joshuas. Thats right. Child. And then his went on the ground. Thats exactly right. Child. So he wont know which one is his. Oh. So now Joshua goes off to get a drink. Ivan comes back and he says, I want my cheese sandwich. So which one do you think Ivan is going to take. Child. I think he is going to take that one. Yeah, you think hes going to take that one. All right. Lets see. Oh yeah, you were right. He took that one. So thats a five year old who clearly understands that other people can have false beliefs and what the consequences are for their actions. Now Im going to show you a three year old who got the same puzzle. And Ivan says, I want my cheese sandwich. Which sandwich is he going to take. Do you think hes going to take that one. Lets see what happens. Lets see what he does. Here comes Ivan. And he says, I want my cheese sandwich. And he takes this one. Uh oh. Why did he take that one. Child. His was on the grass. So the three year old does two things differently. First, he predicts Ivan will take the sandwich thats really his. And second, when he sees Ivan taking the sandwich where he left his, where we would say hes taking that one because he thinks its his, the three year old comes up with another explanation. Hes not taking his own sandwich because he doesnt want it, because now its dirty, on the ground. So thats why hes taking the other sandwich. Now of course, development doesnt end at five. And we can see the continuation of this process of learning to think about other peoples thoughts by upping the ante and asking children now, not for an action prediction, but for a moral judgment. So first Im going to show you the three year old again. RS., So is Ivan being mean and naughty for taking Joshuas sandwich. Child. Yeah. Should Ivan get in trouble for taking Joshuas sandwich. Child. Yeah. So its maybe not surprising he thinks it was mean of Ivan to take Joshuas sandwich, since he thinks Ivan only took Joshuas sandwich to avoid having to eat his own dirty sandwich. But now Im going to show you the five year old. Remember the five year old completely understood why Ivan took Joshuas sandwich. Was Ivan being mean and naughty for taking Joshuas sandwich. Child. Um, yeah. And so, it is not until age seven that we get what looks more like an adult response. Should Ivan get in trouble for taking Joshuas sandwich. Child. No, because the wind should get in trouble. He says the wind should get in trouble for switching the sandwiches. And now what weve started to do in my lab is to put children into the brain scanner and ask whats going on in their brain as they develop this ability to think about other peoples thoughts. So the first thing is that in children we see this same brain region, the Right TPJ, being used while children are thinking about other people. But its not quite like the adult brain. So whereas in the adults, as I told you, this brain region is almost completely specialized, it does almost nothing else except for thinking about other peoples thoughts, in children its much less so, when they are age five to eight, the age range of the children I just showed you. And actually if we even look at eight to 11 year olds, getting into early adolescence, they still dont have quite an adult like brain region. And so, what we can see is that over the course of childhood and even into adolescence, both the cognitive system, our minds ability to think about other minds, and the brain system that supports it are continuing, slowly, to develop. But of course, as youre probably aware, even in adulthood, people differ from one another in how good they are at thinking of other minds, how often they do it and how accurately. And so what we wanted to know was, could differences among adults in how they think about other peoples thoughts be explained in terms of differences in this brain region. So, the first thing that we did is we gave adults a version of the pirate problem that we gave to the kids. And Im going to give that to you now. So Grace and her friend are on a tour of a chemical factory, and they take a break for coffee. And Graces friend asks for some sugar in her coffee. Grace goes to make the coffee and finds by the coffee a pot containing a white powder, which is sugar. But the powder is labeled Deadly Poison, so Grace thinks that the powder is a deadly poison. And she puts it in her friends coffee. And her friend drinks the coffee, and is fine. How many people think it was morally permissible for Grace to put the powder in the coffee. Okay. Good. So we ask people, how much should Grace be blamed in this case, which we call a failed attempt to harm. And we can compare that to another case, where everything in the real world is the same. The powder is still sugar, but whats different is what Grace thinks. Now she thinks the powder is sugar. And perhaps unsurprisingly, if Grace thinks the powder is sugar and puts it in her friends coffee, people say she deserves no blame at all. Whereas if she thinks the powder was poison, even though its really sugar, now people say she deserves a lot of blame, even though what happened in the real world was exactly the same. And in fact, they say she deserves more blame in this case, the failed attempt to harm, than in another case, which we call an accident. Where Grace thought the powder was sugar, because it was labeled sugar and by the coffee machine, but actually the powder was poison. So even though when the powder was poison, the friend drank the coffee and died, people say Grace deserves less blame in that case, when she innocently thought it was sugar, than in the other case, where she thought it was poison and no harm occurred. People, though, disagree a little bit about exactly how much blame Grace should get in the accident case. Some people think she should deserve more blame, and other people less. And what Im going to show you is what happened when we look inside the brains of people while theyre making that judgment. So what Im showing you, from left to right, is how much activity there was in this brain region, and from top to bottom, how much blame people said that Grace deserved. And what you can see is, on the left when there was very little activity in this brain region, people paid little attention to her innocent belief and said she deserved a lot of blame for the accident. Whereas on the right, where there was a lot of activity, people paid a lot more attention to her innocent belief, and said she deserved a lot less blame for causing the accident. So thats good, but of course what wed rather is have a way to interfere with function in this brain region, and see if we could change peoples moral judgment. And we do have such a tool. Its called Trans Cranial Magnetic Stimulation, or TMS. This is a tool that lets us pass a magnetic pulse through somebodys skull, into a small region of their brain, and temporarily disorganize the function of the neurons in that region. So Im going to show you a demo of this. First, Im going to show you that this is a magnetic pulse. Im going to show you what happens when you put a quarter on the machine. When you hear clicks, were turning the machine on. So now Im going to apply that same pulse to my brain, to the part of my brain that controls my hand. So there is no physical force, just a magnetic pulse. Woman , Ready, Rebecca. Yes. Okay, so it causes a small involuntary contraction in my hand by putting a magnetic pulse in my brain. And we can use that same pulse, now applied to the RTPJ, to ask if we can change peoples moral judgments. So these are the judgments I showed you before, peoples normal moral judgments. And then we can apply TMS to the RTPJ and ask how peoples judgments change. And the first thing is, people can still do this task overall. So their judgments of the case when everything was fine remain the same. They say she deserves no blame. But in the case of a failed attempt to harm, where Grace thought that it was poison, although it was really sugar, people now say it was more okay, she deserves less blame for putting the powder in the coffee. And in the case of the accident, where she thought that it was sugar, but it was really poison and so she caused a death, people say that it was less okay, she deserves more blame. So what Ive told you today is that people come, actually, especially well equipped to think about other peoples thoughts. We have a special brain system that lets us think about what other people are thinking. This system takes a long time to develop, slowly throughout the course of childhood and into early adolescence. And even in adulthood, differences in this brain region can explain differences among adults in how we think about and judge other people. But I want to give the last word back to the novelists, and to Philip Roth, who ended by saying, The fact remains that getting people right is not what living is all about anyway. Its getting them wrong that is living. Getting them wrong and wrong and wrong, and then on careful reconsideration, getting them wrong again. Thank you. So, I have a question. When you start talking about using magnetic pulses to change peoples moral judgments, that sounds alarming. Please tell me that youre not taking phone calls from the Pentagon, say. Im not. I mean, theyre calling, but Im not taking the call. They really are calling. So then seriously, you must lie awake at night sometimes wondering where this work leads. I mean, youre clearly an incredible human being, but someone could take this knowledge and in some future not torture chamber, do acts that people here might be worried about. Yeah, we worry about this. So, theres a couple of things to say about TMS. One is that you cant be TMSed without knowing it. So its not a surreptitious technology. Its quite hard, actually, to get those very small changes. The changes I showed you are impressive to me because of what they tell us about the function of the brain, but theyre small on the scale of the moral judgments that we actually make. And what we changed was not peoples moral judgments when theyre deciding what to do, when theyre making action choices. We changed their ability to judge other peoples actions. And so, I think of what Im doing not so much as studying the defendant in a criminal trial, but studying the jury. Is your work going to lead to any recommendations in education, to perhaps bring up a generation of kids able to make fairer moral judgments. Thats one of the idealistic hopes. The whole research program here of studying the distinctive parts of the human brain is brand new. Until recently, what we knew about the brain were the things that any other animals brain could do too, so we could study it in animal models. We knew how brains see, and how they control the body and how they hear and sense. And the whole project of understanding how brains do the uniquely human things, learn language and abstract concepts, and thinking about other peoples thoughts, thats brand new. And we dont know yet what the implications will be of understanding it. So Ive got one last question. There is this thing called the hard problem of consciousness, that puzzles a lot of people. The notion that you can understand why a brain works, perhaps. But why does anyone have to feel anything. Why does it seem to require these beings who sense things for us to operate. Youre a brilliant young neuroscientist. I mean, what chances do you think there are that at some time in your career, someone, you or someone else, is going to come up with some paradigm shift in understanding what seems an impossible problem. I hope they do. And I think they probably wont. Why. Its not called the hard problem of consciousness for nothing. Thats a great answer. Rebecca Saxe, thank you very much. That was fantastic. "
"Hi. Im Kevin Allocca, Im the trends manager at YouTube, and I professionally watch YouTube videos. Its true. So were going to talk a little bit today about how videos go viral and then why that even matters. We all want to be stars, celebrities, singers, comedians, and when I was younger, that seemed so very, very hard to do. But now Web video has made it so that any of us or any of the creative things that we do can become completely famous in a part of our worlds culture. Any one of you could be famous on the Internet by next Saturday. But there are over 48 hours of video uploaded to YouTube every minute. And of that, only a tiny percentage ever goes viral and gets tons of views and becomes a cultural moment. So how does it happen. Three things, tastemakers, communities of participation and unexpectedness. All right, lets go. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Wooo. Ohhhhh, wowwww. Last year, Bear Vasquez posted this video that he had shot outside his home in Yosemite National Park. In 2010, it was viewed 23 million times. This is a chart of what it looked like when it first became popular last summer. But he didnt actually set out to make a viral video, Bear. He just wanted to share a rainbow. Because thats what you do when your name is Yosemite Mountain Bear. And he had posted lots of nature videos in fact. And this video had actually been posted all the way back in January. So what happened here. Jimmy Kimmel actually. Jimmy Kimmel posted this tweet that would eventually propel the video to be as popular as it would become. Because tastemakers like Jimmy Kimmel introduce us to new and interesting things and bring them to a larger audience. Its Friday, Friday. Gotta get down on Friday. Everybodys looking forward to the weekend, weekend. Friday, Friday. Gettin down on Friday. So you didnt think that we could actually have this conversation without talking about this video I hope. Rebecca Blacks Friday is one of the most popular videos of the year. Its been seen nearly 200 million times this year. This is a chart of what it looked like. And similar to Double Rainbow, it seems to have just sprouted up out of nowhere. So what happened on this day. Well it was a Friday, this is true. And if youre wondering about those other spikes, those are also Fridays. But what about this day, this one particular Friday. Well Tosh.0 picked it up, a lot of blogs starting writing about. Michael J. Nelson from Mystery Science Theater was one of the first people to post a joke about the video on Twitter. But whats important is that an individual or a group of tastemakers took a point of view and they shared that with a larger audience, accelerating the process. And so then this community formed of people who shared this big inside joke and they started talking about it and doing things with it. And now there are 10,000 parodies of Friday on YouTube. Even in the first seven days, there was one parody for every other day of the week. Unlike the one way entertainment of the 20th century, this community participation is how we become a part of the phenomenon, either by spreading it or by doing something new with it. So Nyan Cat is a looped animation with looped music. Its this, just like this. Its been viewed nearly 50 million times this year. And if you think that that is weird, you should know that there is a three hour version of this thats been viewed four million times. Even cats were watching this video. Cats were watching other cats watch this video. But whats important here is the creativity that it inspired amongst this techie, geeky Internet culture. There were remixes. Someone made an old timey version. And then it went international. An entire remix community sprouted up that brought it from being just a stupid joke to something that we can all actually be a part of. Because we dont just enjoy now, we participate. And who could have predicted any of this. Who could have predicted Double Rainbow or Rebecca Black or Nyan Cat. What scripts could you have written that would have contained this in it. In a world where over two days of video get uploaded every minute, only that which is truly unique and unexpected can stand out in the way that these things have. When a friend of mine told me that I needed to see this great video about a guy protesting bicycle fines in New York City, I admit I wasnt very interested. So I got a ticket for not riding in the bike lane, but often there are obstructions that keep you from properly riding in the bike lane. By being totally surprising and humorous, Casey Niestat got his funny idea and point seen five million times. And so this approach holds for anything new that we do creatively. And so it all brings us to one big question ... What does this mean. Ohhhh. What does it mean. Tastemakers, creative participating communities, complete unexpectedness, these are characteristics of a new kind of media and a new kind of culture where anyone has access and the audience defines the popularity. I mean, as mentioned earlier, one of the biggest stars in the world right now, Justin Bieber, got his start on YouTube. No one has to green light your idea. And we all now feel some ownership in our own pop culture. And these are not characteristics of old media, and theyre barely true of the media of today, but they will define the entertainment of the future. Thank you. "
"I want to talk to you about, or share with you, a breakthrough new approach for managing items of inventory inside of a warehouse. Were talking about a pick, pack and ship setting here. So as a hint, this solution involves hundreds of mobile robots, sometimes thousands of mobile robots, moving around a warehouse. And Ill get to the solution. But for a moment, just think about the last time that you ordered something online. You were sitting on your couch and you decided that you absolutely had to have this red t shirt. So, click., you put it into your shopping cart. And then you decided that green pair of pants looks pretty good too, click. And maybe a blue pair of shoes, click. So at this point youve assembled your order. You didnt stop to think for a moment that that might not be a great outfit. But you hit submit order. And two days later, this package shows up on your doorstep. And you open the box and youre like, wow, theres my goo. Did you ever stop to think about how those items of inventory actually found their way inside that box in the warehouse. So Im here to tell you its that guy right there. So deep in the middle of that picture, you see a classic pick pack worker in a distribution or order fulfillments setting. Classically these pick workers will spend 60 or 70 percent of their day wandering around the warehouse. Theyll often walk as much as 5 or 10 miles in pursuit of those items of inventory. Not only is this an unproductive way to fill orders, it also turns out to be an unfulfilling way to fill orders. So let me tell you where I first bumped into this problem. I was out in the Bay area in 99, 2000, the dot com boom. I worked for a fabulously spectacular flame out called Webvan. This company raised hundreds of millions of dollars with the notion that we will deliver grocery orders online. And it really came down to the fact that we couldnt do it cost effectively. Turns out e commerce was something that was very hard and very costly. In this particular instance we were trying to assemble 30 items of inventory into a few totes, onto a van to deliver to the home. And when you think about it, it was costing us 30 dollars. Imagine, we had an 89 can of soup that was costing us one dollar to pick and pack into that tote. And thats before we actually tried to deliver it to the home. So long story short, during my one year at Webvan, what I realized by talking to all the material handling providers was that there was no solution designed specifically to solve each base picking. Red item, green, blue, getting those three things in a box. So we said, theres just got to be a better way to do this. Existing material handling was set up to pump pallets and cases of goo to retail stores. Of course Webvan went out of business, and about a year and a half later, I was still noodling on this problem. It was still nagging at me. And I started thinking about it again. And I said, let me just focus briefly on what I wanted as a pick worker, or my vision for how it should work. I said, lets focus on the problem. I have an order here and what I want to do is I want to put red, green and blue in this box right here. What I need is a system where I put out my hand and, poof., the product shows up and I pack it into the order, and now were thinking, this would be a very operator centric approach to solving the problem. This is what I need. What technology is available to solve this problem. But as you can see, orders can come and go, products can come and go. It allows us to focus on making the pick worker the center of the problem, and providing them the tools to make them as productive as possible. So how did I arrive at this notion. Well, actually it came from a brainstorming exercise, probably a technique that many of you use, Its this notion of testing your ideas. Take a blank sheet, of course, but then test your ideas at the limits, infinity, zero. In this particular case, we challenged ourselves with the idea. What if we had to build a distribution center in China, where its a very, very low cost market. And say, labor is cheap, land is cheap. And we said specifically, What if it was zero dollars an hour for direct labor and we could build a million square foot distribution center. So naturally that led to ideas that said, Lets put lots of people in the warehouse. And I said, Hold on, zero dollars per hour, what I would do is hire 10,000 workers to come to the warehouse every morning at 8 a.m., walk into the warehouse and pick up one item of inventory and then just stand there. So you hold Captain Crunch, you hold the Mountain Dew, you hold the Diet Coke. If I need it, Ill call you, otherwise just stand there. But when I need Diet Coke and I call it, you guys talk amongst yourselves. Diet Coke walks up to the front, pick it, put it in the tote, away it goes. Wow, what if the products could walk and talk on their own. Thats a very interesting, very powerful way that we could potentially organize this warehouse. So of course, labor isnt free, on that practical versus awesome spectrum. So we said mobile shelving, Well put them on mobile shelving. Well use mobile robots and well move the inventory around. And so we got underway on that and then Im sitting on my couch in 2008. Did any of you see the Beijing Olympics, the opening ceremonies. I about fell out of my couch when I saw this. Im like, that was the idea. Well put thousands of people on the warehouse floor, the stadium floor. But interestingly enough, this actually relates to the idea in that these guys were creating some incredibly powerful, impressive digital art, all without computers, Im told, it was all peer to peer coordination and communication. You stand up, Ill squat down. And they made some fabulous art. It speaks to the power of emergence in systems when you let things start to talk with each other. So that was a little bit of the journey. So of course, now what became the practical reality of this idea. Here is a warehouse. Its a pick, pack and ship center that has about 10,000 different SKUs. Well call them red pens, green pens, yellow Post It Notes. We send the little orange robots out to pick up the blue shelving pods. And we deliver them to the side of the building. So all the pick workers now get to stay on the perimeter. And the game here is to pick up the shelves, take them down the highway and deliver them straight to the pick worker. This pick workers life is completely different. Rather than wandering around the warehouse, she gets to stay still in a pick station like this and every product in the building can now come to her. So the process is very productive. Reach in, pick an item, scan the bar code, pack it out. By the time you turn around, theres another product there ready to be picked and packed. So what weve done is take out all of the non value added walking, searching, wasting, waited time, and weve developed a very high fidelity way to pick these orders, where you point at it with a laser, scan the UPC barcode, and then indicate with a light which box it needs to go into. So more productive, more accurate and, it turns out, its a more interesting office environment for these pick workers. They actually complete the whole order. So they do red, green and blue, not just a part of the order. And they feel a little bit more in control of their environment. So the side effects of this approach are what really surprised us. We knew it was going to be more productive. But we didnt realize just how pervasive this way of thinking extended to other functions in the warehouse. But what effectively this approach is doing inside of the DC is turning it into a massively parallel processing engine. So this is again a cross fertilization of ideas. Heres a warehouse and were thinking about parallel processing supercomputer architectures. The notion here is that you have 10 workers on the right side of the screen that are now all independent autonomous pick workers. If the worker in station three decides to leave and go to the bathroom, it has no impact on the productivity of the other nine workers. Contrast that, for a moment, with the traditional method of using a conveyor. When one person passes the order to you, you put something in and pass it downstream. Everyone has to be in place for that serial process to work. This becomes a more robust way to think about the warehouse. And then underneath the hoods gets interesting in that were tracking the popularity of the products. And were using dynamic and adaptive algorithms to tune the floor of the warehouse. So what you see here potentially the week leading up to Valentines Day. All that pink chalky candy has moved to the front of the building and is now being picked into a lot of orders in those pick stations. Come in two days after Valentines Day, and that candy, the leftover candy, has all drifted to the back of the warehouse and is occupying the cooler zone on the thermal map there. One other side effect of this approach using the parallel processing is these things can scale to ginormous. So whether youre doing two pick stations, 20 pick stations, or 200 pick stations, the path planning algorithms and all of the inventory algorithms just work. In this example you see that the inventory has now occupied all the perimeter of the building because thats where the pick stations were. They sorted it out for themselves. So Ill conclude with just one final video that shows how this comes to bear on the pick workers actual day in the life of. So as we mentioned, the process is to move inventory along the highway and then find your way into these pick stations. And our software in the background understands whats going on in each station, we direct the pods across the highway and were attempting to get into a queuing system to present the work to the pick worker. Whats interesting is we can even adapt the speed of the pick workers. The faster pickers get more pods and the slower pickers get few. But this pick worker now is literally having that experience that we described before. She puts out her hand. The product jumps into it. Or she has to reach in and get it. She scans it and she puts it in the bucket. And all of the rest of the technology is kind of behind the scenes. So she gets to now focus on the picking and packing portion of her job. Never has any idle time, never has to leave her mat. And actually we think not only a more productive and more accurate way to fill orders. We think its a more fulfilling way to fill orders. The reason we can say that, though, is that workers in a lot of these buildings now compete for the privilege of working in the Kiva zone that day. And sometimes well catch them on testimonial videos saying such things as, they have more energy after the day to play with their grandchildren, or in one case a guy said, the Kiva zone is so stress free that Ive actually stopped taking my blood pressure medication. That was at a pharmaceutical distributor, so they told us not to use that video. So what I wanted to leave you with today is the notion that when you let things start to think and walk and talk on their own, interesting processes and productivities can emerge. And now I think next time you go to your front step and pick up that box that you just ordered online, you break it open and the goo is in there, youll have some wonderment as to whether a robot assisted in the picking and packing of that order. Thank you. "
"As an Indian, and now as a politician and a government minister, Ive become rather concerned about the hype were hearing about our own country, all this talk about India becoming a world leader, even the next superpower. In fact, the American publishers of my book, The Elephant, The Tiger and the Cell Phone, added a gratuitous subtitle saying, India. The next 21st century power. And I just dont think thats what Indias all about, or should be all about. Indeed, what worries me is the entire notion of world leadership seems to me terribly archaic. Its redolent of James Bond movies and Kipling ballads. After all, what constitutes a world leader. If its population, were on course to top the charts. We will overtake China by 2034. Is it military strength. Well, we have the worlds fourth largest army. Is it nuclear capacity. We know we have that. The Americans have even recognized it, in an agreement. Is it the economy. Well, we have now the fifth largest economy in the world in purchasing power parity terms. And we continue to grow. When the rest of the world took a beating last year, we grew at 6.7 percent. But, somehow, none of that adds up to me, to what I think India really can aim to contribute in the world, in this part of the 21st century. And so I wondered, could what the future beckons for India to be all about be a combination of these things allied to something else, the power of example, the attraction of Indias culture, what, in other words, people like to call soft power. Soft power is a concept invented by a Harvard academic, Joseph Nye, a friend of mine. And, very simply, and Im really cutting it short because of the time limits here, its essentially the ability of a country to attract others because of its culture, its political values, its foreign policies. And, you know, lots of countries do this. He was writing initially about the States, but we know the Alliance Francaise is all about French soft power, the British Council. The Beijing Olympics were an exercise in Chinese soft power. Americans have the Voice of America and the Fulbright scholarships. But, the fact is, in fact, that probably Hollywood and MTV and McDonalds have done more for American soft power around the world than any specifically government activity. So soft power is something that really emerges partly because of governments, but partly despite governments. And in the information era we all live in today, what we might call the TED age, Id say that countries are increasingly being judged by a global public thats been fed on an incessant diet of Internet news, of televised images, of cellphone videos, of email gossip. In other words, all sorts of communication devices are telling us the stories of countries, whether or not the countries concerned want people to hear those stories. Now, in this age, again, countries with access to multiple channels of communication and information have a particular advantage. And of course they have more influence, sometimes, about how theyre seen. India has more all news TV channels than any country in the world, in fact in most of the countries in this part of the world put together. But, the fact still is that its not just that. In order to have soft power, you have to be connected. One might argue that India has become an astonishingly connected country. I think youve already heard the figures. Weve been selling 15 million cellphones a month. Currently there are 509 million cellphones in Indian hands, in India. And that makes us larger than the U.S. as a telephone market. In fact, those 15 million cellphones are the most connections that any country, including the U.S. and China, has ever established in the history of telecommunications. But, what perhaps some of you dont realize is how far weve come to get there. You know, when I grew up in India, telephones were a rarity. In fact, they were so rare that elected members of Parliament had the right to allocate 15 telephone lines as a favor to those they deemed worthy. If you were lucky enough to be a wealthy businessman or an influential journalist, or a doctor or something, you might have a telephone. But sometimes it just sat there. I went to high school in Calcutta. And we would look at this instrument sitting in the front foyer. But half the time we would pick it up with an expectant look on our faces, there would be no dial tone. If there was a dial tone and you dialed a number, the odds were two in three you wouldnt get the number you were intending to reach. In fact the words wrong number were more popular than the word Hello. If you then wanted to connect to another city, lets say from Calcutta you wanted to call Delhi, youd have to book something called a trunk call, and then sit by the phone all day, waiting for it to come through. Or you could pay eight times the going rate for something called a lightning call. But, lightning struck rather slowly in our country in those days, so, it was like about a half an hour for a lightning call to come through. In fact, so woeful was our telephone service that a Member of Parliament stood up in 1984 and complained about this. And the Then Communications Minister replied in a lordly manner that in a developing country communications are a luxury, not a right, that the government had no obligation to provide better service, and if the honorable Member wasnt satisfied with his telephone, could he please return it, since there was an eight year long waiting list for telephones in India. Now, fast forward to today and this is what you see, the 15 million cell phones a month. But what is most striking is who is carrying those cell phones. You know, if you visit friends in the suburbs of Delhi, on the side streets you will find a fellow with a cart that looks like it was designed in the 16th century, wielding a coal fired steam iron that might have been invented in the 18th century. Hes called an isthri wala. But hes carrying a 21st century instrument. Hes carrying a cell phone because most incoming calls are free, and thats how he gets orders from the neighborhood, to know where to collect clothes to get them ironed. The other day I was in Kerala, my home state, at the country farm of a friend, about 20 kilometers away from any place youd consider urban. And it was a hot day and he said, Hey, would you like some fresh coconut water. And its the best thing and the most nutritious and refreshing thing you can drink on a hot day in the tropics, so I said sure. And he whipped out his cellphone, dialed the number, and a voice said, Im up here. And right on top of the nearest coconut tree, with a hatchet in one hand and a cell phone in the other, was a local toddy tapper, who proceeded to bring down the coconuts for us to drink. Fishermen are going out to sea and carrying their cell phones. When they catch the fish they call all the market towns along the coast to find out where they get the best possible prices. Farmers now, who used to have to spend half a day of backbreaking labor to find out if the market town was open, if the market was on, whether the product theyd harvested could be sold, what price theyd fetch. Theyd often send an eight year old boy all the way on this trudge to the market town to get that information and come back, then theyd load the cart. Today theyre saving half a days labor with a two minute phone call. So this empowerment of the underclass is the real result of India being connected. And that transformation is part of where India is heading today. But, of course thats not the only thing about India thats spreading. Youve got Bollywood. My attitude to Bollywood is best summarized in the tale of the two goats at a Bollywood garbage dump, Mr. Shekhar Kapur, forgive me, and theyre chewing away on cans of celluloid discarded by a Bollywood studio. And the first goat, chewing away, says, You know, this film is not bad. And the second goat says, No, the book was better. I usually tend to think that the book is usually better, but, having said that, the fact is that Bollywood is now taking a certain aspect of Indian ness and Indian culture around the globe, not just in the Indian diaspora in the U.S. and the U.K., but to the screens of Arabs and Africans, of Senegalese and Syrians. Ive met a young man in New York whose illiterate mother in a village in Senegal takes a bus once a month to the capital city of Dakar, just to watch a Bollywood movie. She cant understand the dialogue. Shes illiterate, so she cant read the French subtitles. But these movies are made to be understood despite such handicaps, and she has a great time in the song and the dance and the action. She goes away with stars in her eyes about India, as a result. And this is happening more and more. Afghanistan, we know what a serious security problem Afghanistan is for so many of us in the world. India doesnt have a military mission there. You know what was Indias biggest asset in Afghanistan in the last seven years. One simple fact, you couldnt try to call an Afghan at 8 30 in the evening. Why. Because that was the moment when the Indian television soap opera, Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi, dubbed into Dari, was telecast on Tolo T.V. And it was the most popular television show in Afghan history. Every Afghan family wanted to watch it. They had to suspend functions at 8 30. Weddings were reported to be interrupted so guests could cluster around the T.V. set, and then turn their attention back to the bride and groom. Crime went up at 8 30. I have read a Reuters dispatch, so this is not Indian propaganda, a British news agency, about how robbers in the town of Musarri Sharif stripped a vehicle of its windshield wipers, its hubcaps, its sideview mirrors, any moving part they could find, at 8 30, because the watchmen were busy watching the T.V. rather than minding the store. And they scrawled on the windshield in a reference to the shows heroine, Tulsi Zindabad, Long live Tulsi. Thats soft power. And that is what India is developing through the E part of its own entertainment industry. The same is true, of course, we dont have time for too many more examples, but its true of our music, of our dance, of our art, yoga, ayurveda, even Indian cuisine. I mean, the proliferation of Indian restaurants since I first went abroad as a student, in the mid 70s, and what I see today, you cant go to a mid size town in Europe or North America and not find an Indian restaurant. It may not be a very good one. But, today in Britain, for example, Indian restaurants in Britain employ more people than the coal mining, ship building and iron and steel industries combined. So the empire can strike back. But, with this increasing awareness of India, with yoga and ayurveda, and so on, with tales like Afghanistan, comes something vital in the information era, the sense that in todays world its not the side of the bigger army that wins, its the country that tells a better story that prevails. And India is, and must remain, in my view, the land of the better story. Stereotypes are changing. I mean, again, having gone to the U.S. as a student in the mid 70s, I knew what the image of India was then, if there was an image at all. Today, people in Silicon Valley and elsewhere speak of the IITs, the Indian Institutes of Technology with the same reverence they used to accord to MIT. This can sometimes have unintended consequences. OK. I had a friend, a history major like me, who was accosted at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam, by an anxiously perspiring European saying, Youre Indian, youre Indian. Can you help me fix my laptop. Weve gone from the image of India as land of fakirs lying on beds of nails, and snake charmers with the Indian rope trick, to the image of India as a land of mathematical geniuses, computer wizards, software gurus. But that too is transforming the Indian story around the world. But, there is something more substantive to that. The story rests on a fundamental platform of political pluralism. Its a civilizational story to begin with. Because India has been an open society for millennia. India gave refuge to the Jews, fleeing the destruction of the first temple by the Babylonians, and said thereafter by the Romans. In fact, legend has is that when Doubting Thomas, the Apostle, Saint Thomas, landed on the shores of Kerala, my home state, somewhere around 52 A.D., he was welcomed on shore by a flute playing Jewish girl. And to this day remains the only Jewish diaspora in the history of the Jewish people, which has never encountered a single incident of anti semitism. Thats the Indian story. Islam came peacefully to the south, slightly more differently complicated history in the north. But all of these religions have found a place and a welcome home in India. You know, we just celebrated, this year, our general elections, the biggest exercise in democratic franchise in human history. And the next one will be even bigger, because our voting population keeps growing by 20 million a year. But, the fact is that the last elections, five years ago, gave the world extraordinary phenomenon of an election being won by a woman political leader of Italian origin and Roman Catholic faith, Sonia Gandhi, who then made way for a Sikh, Mohan Singh, to be sworn in as Prime Minister by a Muslim, President Abdul Kalam, in a country 81 percent Hindu. This is India, and of course its all the more striking because it was four years later that we all applauded the U.S., the oldest democracy in the modern world, more than 220 years of free and fair elections, which took till last year to elect a president or a vice president who wasnt white, male or Christian. So, maybe, oh sorry, he is Christian, I beg your pardon, and he is male, but he isnt white. All the others have been all those three. All his predecessors have been all those three, and thats the point I was trying to make. But, the issue is that when I talked about that example, its not just about talking about India, its not propaganda. Because ultimately, that electoral outcome had nothing to do with the rest of the world. It was essentially India being itself. And ultimately, it seems to me, that always works better than propaganda. Governments arent very good at telling stories. But people see a society for what it is, and that, it seems to me, is what ultimately will make a difference in todays information era, in todays TED age. So India now is no longer the nationalism of ethnicity or language or religion, because we have every ethnicity known to mankind, practically, weve every religion know to mankind, with the possible exception of Shintoism, though that has some Hindu elements somewhere. We have 23 official languages that are recognized in our Constitution. And those of you who cashed your money here might be surprised to see how many scripts there are on the rupee note, spelling out the denominations. Weve got all of that. We dont even have geography uniting us, because the natural geography of the subcontinent framed by the mountains and the sea was hacked by the partition with Pakistan in 1947. In fact, you cant even take the name of the country for granted, because the name India comes from the river Indus, which flows in Pakistan. But, the whole point is that India is the nationalism of an idea. Its the idea of an ever ever land, emerging from an ancient civilization, united by a shared history, but sustained, above all, by pluralist democracy. That is a 21st century story as well as an ancient one. And its the nationalism of an idea that essentially says you can endure differences of caste, creed, color, culture, cuisine, custom and costume, consonant, for that matter, and still rally around a consensus. And the consensus is of a very simple principle, that in a diverse plural democracy like India you dont really have to agree on everything all the time, so long as you agree on the ground rules of how you will disagree. The great success story of India, a country that so many learned scholars and journalists assumed would disintegrate, in the 50s and 60s, is that it managed to maintain consensus on how to survive without consensus. Now, that is the India that is emerging into the 21st century. And I do want to make the point that if there is anything worth celebrating about India, it isnt military muscle, economic power. All of that is necessary, but we still have huge amounts of problems to overcome. Somebody said we are super poor, and we are also super power. We cant really be both of those. We have to overcome our poverty. We have to deal with the hardware of development, the ports, the roads, the airports, all the infrastructural things we need to do, and the software of development, the human capital, the need for the ordinary person in India to be able to have a couple of square meals a day, to be able to send his or her children to a decent school, and to aspire to work a job that will give them opportunities in their lives that can transform themselves. But, its all taking place, this great adventure of conquering those challenges, those real challenges which none of us can pretend dont exist. But, its all taking place in an open society, in a rich and diverse and plural civilization, in one that is determined to liberate and fulfill the creative energies of its people. Thats why India belongs at TED, and thats why TED belongs in India. Thank you very much. "
